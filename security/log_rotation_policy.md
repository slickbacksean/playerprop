- Ensure no data loss during rotation
- Maintain log integrity and chain of custody

## 8. Security Measures
- Restrict log file access to authorized personnel
- Encrypt archived logs
- Implement access logging for log management systems

## 9. Monitoring and Auditing
- Regular audit of log rotation processes
- Quarterly review of log retention effectiveness
- Annual compliance check of log management practices

## 10. Exceptions
