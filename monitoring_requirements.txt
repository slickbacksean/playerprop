# System Monitoring and Performance Requirements

## 1. Performance Monitoring Objectives
- Ensure optimal system performance
- Detect and prevent potential bottlenecks
- Maintain high availability and responsiveness

## 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
### 2.1 Application Performance
- Response Time
- Throughput
- Error Rate
- Resource Utilization

### 2.2 Machine Learning Model Performance
- Prediction Accuracy
- Model Inference Time
- Training Time
- Resource Consumption

## 3. Monitoring Tools
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- New Relic
- Datadog

## 4. Metrics to Track
### 4.1 System Metrics
- CPU Usage
- Memory Consumption
- Disk I/O
- Network Latency
- Concurrent Users

### 4.2 Application Metrics
- API Response Times
- Database Query Performance
- Cache Hit/Miss Rates
- Error Logging
- Request Volume

### 4.3 Machine Learning Metrics
- Model Prediction Latency
- Feature Processing Time
